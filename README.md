# Small_RNA_analysis
This repository contains some of the instructions and scripts used to analyse Maize small RNAs.

Some of the results of these scripts belong on the manscript in revision:

* Alejandri-Ramírez ND, Chávez-Hernández EC, Contreras-Guerra JL, Reyes-Taboada JL, Dinkova TD. Differential small RNA expression upon induction and establishment of Tuxpeño maize embryogenic callus cultures.

If you found the method of analysis or some of the scripts useful for your scientific work please cite our work.

The first step for the analysis of the small RNAs (sRNAs) was the collection and classification of sequences from different databases to analyse and asign a putative origin for the sRNAs. See [here.](https://github.com/Fatallis/Small_RNA_analysis/blob/master/Database_collection.md)
